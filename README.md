# Canadian Securities course - Virtual Portfolio

A $100,000 virtual investment portfolio was formed between September 28 and November 19. Securities were bought and traded virtually throughout this time period. The cost of the shares was continuously monitored during this time. Additionally, the performance of an index and a portfolio return was compared. In this assignment, a portfolio was created using MS Excel, and Excel graphics were also used to compare the initial and final portfolios.
